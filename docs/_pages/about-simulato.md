Simulato is an open source testing tool written in Node.js by the Quality Engineering Test Infrastructure team at Gannett. The tool is designed to meet the need for testing web user interfaces, using the theory of model based testing.

When using model based testing users create small, resuable components found in a website (such as input boxes, select boxes, forms etc..) which are combined to descibe the system under test. Test scripts are then generated by the tool using these components. These tests can then be run against the system to test expected behavior.

[Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) is used to interact with the browser during execution, allowing users to use familiar selenium paradigms when creating components.
