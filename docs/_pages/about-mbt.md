## Definition
* Describing system requirements and behavior as a model​
* Generating tests from the those models​

## Benefits vs Costs

### Benefits
  * Software behavior specified once
  * Lower maintenance
  * Very high coverage
  * Independent of system implementation

### Costs
  * Steep learning curve
  * More up front effort

## Use Cases
  * Can generate many tests paths from models for high test coverage

  * Can generate optimized path from models for minimum cost and maximum coverage
